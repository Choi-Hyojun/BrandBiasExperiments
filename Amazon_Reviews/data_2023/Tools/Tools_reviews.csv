5.0,Grandkids & my kids love them! Bought 16 for Xmas!,"Every year I seem to buy something that ends up being a family gift. This was 2021.  I bought 5 for my kids & 11 for my grandkids. I’m buying myself one next.  Technically I bought 17, but mine was damaged. I returned it & I just have not reordered it yet bc I truly cannot choose which design I want now. There are so many choices.  It was nice to be able to buy an owl for one grandkid, unicorns for others, & dinosaurs & dragons too.  While input based 5 identical lights for my 5 kids that say I love you to the moon & back I did not duplicate a single grandchild‘s design. They each have their own unique lamp & they absolutely love them.",[],B092VPJV2S,B092VPJV2S,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,1642400423196,0,True

4.0,Fanciness over functionality- my pair anyways.,"[[VIDEOID:fe0ded02cc8947de907313d213474717]] These are pretty, but the obvious design flaw is the extremely sharp scrolled bits that I’ve already cut my fingers on several times.  If they had curved the scroll back into itself instead of outwards it probably would have been okay, but as it is it both snags all of your fabrics & threads, but also tears your skin if you aren’t extremely careful.  So if I keep them I will either cover the sharp tips with glue, file them down, or use a soldering iron to reshape that part of the metal if I can find out if it’s safe to solder that type of metal.  The other issue I had is that the blades rub together as you can clearly see in the pics as it’s leaving marks on the metal.  As I intended to use these as embroidery snips I only need to open the scissors a tiny amount so it’s not terribly awful, but it does limit what I can do with these scissors as I had hoped to also use them for appliqué.  They are pretty & I like the overall design, but the manufacturer needs to fix the handles where the sharp parts are because it’s damaging to your expensive supplies & your body.  I have large hands for a girl which was the main reason I picked these bc I saw the handles appeared to have larger openings for the hands & they do.  As it has a screw holding the blades together I might try to adjust them to get the blades to be more fluid & not rub together & not dig into each other, but so far it just looks like the engineering is a hair off. The angles of the blades appear as though they will rub even after adjusting.  I hope not because other than what I’ve stated I like them.  They have a couple of design flaws, but I’m hoping I can work my way around them.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1+UkjnHs3L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1+UkjnHs3L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1+UkjnHs3L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A199G4xE3zL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A199G4xE3zL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A199G4xE3zL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1K1VKSGhXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1K1VKSGhXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1K1VKSGhXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1pdYxUaBdL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1pdYxUaBdL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A1pdYxUaBdL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1GeWCEufYS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1GeWCEufYS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1GeWCEufYS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1O1jQfMNyS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1O1jQfMNyS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1O1jQfMNyS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1ZG3p599KS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1h7w2Bcu4S._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1h7w2Bcu4S._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1h7w2Bcu4S._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1o5jllFidS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1o5jllFidS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1o5jllFidS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C14kivCpjGS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C14kivCpjGS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C14kivCpjGS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07Y1XT2QS,B07Y1XT2QS,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,1628652405491,0,True

5.0,"Nice leash, but I hate the snap!","I bought this specifically so yhst when my adorable grandkids walk my dogs and theirs they don’t drag our other very expensive 6 foot long leashes o. He ground and running mnhhem by fraying them. I live on a budget so making things last and jerking then pretty and I’m working order is a big deal to me. The fraying breaks my other leashes down and loosens the weave that makes them strong. I love these leashes. They are the perfect length for waking gigs and making them heel right next to you. The bungee part allows them to step off the sidewalk and go their business in the grass. I like them so much I now have 2 with 1 red and 1blue. The only hbu g I’m not grilled about is the bolt on the end.  They have a spring that renders them useless sometimes on other products I’ve purchased.  I would normally and probably should return this product now yhst I can see what type of snap/bolt they use, but I am disabled and returns that I have to drive to ups are a pain in the butt, but since this snap is functional I will use it until it eventually quits working and then I will take the bungee leash apart and replace the snap and continue up use it because the rest of it is very well made.  I purchaed it to Ide with my daughter Samantha’s husky/German Shepherd mixed dog who is still a puppy and does not know his own strength. He tends to pull on the leash in training and I was hoping to avoid that in the future due to my disabilities that include pins and rods holding my back together.  The bungee part of the leash  gives me enough notice to brace for impact when Bjkrn decides to try to bolt after bunnies and my grandkids. He’s just a big old baby that wants to have fun and I’m a broken grandma trying to hang on!  Lol. This leash allows me to do that without risk of further injuries!",[],B0772GCXF2,B0772GCXF2,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,1534446008538,0,True

5.0,Two easy fixes made rasp file a 5 rating for me.,"The rasp file needs a handle to be comfortable to use.  Made one from a 4.5 inch section of rubber hose with inner diameter of 3/4 inch.  To insert the rasp file in handle, with curved side of hose down on flat surface, compress with heel of palm, as rasp file is inserted into hose.  When released, handle firmly grips rasp file.<br /><br />Filed off edge rows of rasp teeth so  they would not scratch work when using the files. Gently and slowly running the rasp file edges between thumb and index finger then index finger over the file will confirm all the burrs removed.

Now with a simple voice command to Alexa or even setting up the lights on a timer, I don't have to go in and out of my house to turn lights on or off.

When I saw this filter I thought I would try it. It was easy to install and actually works. In addition to now not having to worry about water spots in the shower any longer, I now also reap the benefit of better, filtered water for my hair and body (and no chlorine).

It was like they were stripped. Anyway, one of my blades only has one screw holding it on the frame. Not sure if anyone else had this problem. I tried using tape to secure it, but not sure if it will hold. I had my neighbor take a look at it and he told me it is defective.

Right out of the box, the Dewalt delivered flawlessly. Quick, long-lasting charge, the Dewalt quickly and effortlessly did my driveway, walkway and even my patio (several hours of usage).

Add in that they also have a COB ( Chip On Board) light panel built into the side that is also extremely bright and acts as a miniature floodlight… You do need to cycle the switch in the tail cap in order to access your desired function so the only two things that are detrimental are : cycling the tail switch and battery life. I think that there might be an inverter or voltage doubler to boost the 1.5v of the AA cell up to 3 volts or so to get the brightness that is produced, but at the cost of battery life.  Feed em some good Alkaline batteries and scatter them around wherever you expect to need a flashlight or give them to family and friends.

1.0,"Recessed lighting LED, set of 20","Recessed LED lights, set of 20.  We have a very small kitchen and 4 recessed lights.  Our old LED recessed lights, approximately 10 years old, began to fail and we purchased these as replacements.  We replace all LED lights in a series (like in the kitchen) at once - even if only one is failing - as in this case.  I am VERY disappointed in these.  First, they are a fraction of the weight of the old ones - quality?  I know things 'improve' with time- sometimes getting lighter in weight, but in this case - NO.  We installed them and in the process discovered they have 4 light brightness/color settings.  The lower wattage you go, the more 'yellow' the lights become.  Now for the real kicker - and kiss of death - they strobe or flicker or phase in and out - whatever phrase you want to call it.  When on the brightest setting, every 4 seconds - on the dimmest setting every 15 seconds.  I get migraines over such flickering - so they are junk to us.  I have read other reviews complaining about these since purchasing and a lot are suggesting you MUST install a 'dimmer' switch to control the flicker!  That is not an option in our kitchen as we have dual light switches.  But even if it was, I would return them.  The old ones didn't flicker. Our house is completely LED and NONE of them flicker.  So, they are being returned flat out.  BEWARE.  If you purchase these they are probably going to flicker - if that doesn't bother you, fine.  If it does, as with most folks, do not purchase these.  I cannot recommend these to anyone for any reason.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

Because the others had a little bit of felt rolled up the sides, the silicone didn't tear and the chair slide more easily.  Just sayin.  We took these off and replaced with the others.

It was very easy to install - they included 3 screws for each knob (6 in total) of three different lengths - you should be able to install this knob on just about anything of reasonable thickness.  I put it on my huge electric fireplace unit.  It's perfect in my opinion.  Now, having said that - this area on my fireplace is actually a hidden storage area - so I needed to be able to ""open"" this area.  I did very gently, slightly bend the wings up just a tiny bit so that I could better fit my fingers under the wings to lift out this board - it is not a drawer.  Works perfectly.  I don't get into that area often and so I wanted the dragonfly as something better to look at.  It does look a tiny bit ""low"" because the dragonfly body is long, but honestly, I like the way it looks.  The body is straight, not curved which is good - it looks like a resting dragonfly - they keep their bodies straight most of the time.  I am very happy with my purchase.

5.0,chair leg covers,"We just installed a bunch of new vinyl flooring where carpet had been. So, instead of the plastic nubs that help you slide on carpet, you need to switch to the felt based tips.  We've been through a whole passel of felt squares - our chairs have 1 1/4"" square legs.  The felts with the stickers just slide off and never stay in place.  I never tried the ""tack"" on or screw on types for fear of harming my floor - and then we found these!  These are a really good design.  They are different than other silicone sleeve with the felt squares only at the bottom... those slip and tear the silicone, eventually coming off.  SO FAR - these have stayed in place perfectly, without slipping.  Key is that the felt square rounds UP the side of silicone sock.  Slides A LOT better across the floor as you're sitting on the chair than any of the other stick on felts.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Time will tell if these are as good as they seem to be.  We have four chairs so we used 16 tips and you get 24.  So there are replacements should they become necessary.

4.0,under cabinet LED light strip,"Unless you're attaching to a metal surface, do not plan to use the magnets to attach the light to.  It did come with some sticky pads to use, thank goodness.  The discs don't magnet to ANYTHING. The whole magnet option what really not an option.  Disappointing.  After all that, I did get it attached under my wooden cabinet over my washer.  The control is connected to the power cord, so I did make a separate purchase of some clear cord keepers that worked perfecting to keep the cord out of the way.  The controller has a red light when it's off so it's easy to see where to hit the power on button.  There are 4 options on the controller - brighter, dimmer, power on/off and a circular icon which when pressed goes through 3 color options... a cool bright white, a softer white and a yellow white.  The light bar itself is really tiny... it's about 1/2"" wide but it's bright and works for me as a light over the top of my washing machine.  The body is a silver colored metal (maybe aluminum?) - the cord and plug in is white.  The cord is a USB but included is a regular plug to accommodate if you don't have a USB outlet where ever you are using it.  Hope it works for awhile, but time will tell!

5.0,silicone face cover frames,"I just received these and haven't used them fully yet... but a couple of things.  These happen to fit my face perfectly.  I read another review that complained it created ""gaps"" under their eyes - I think it must have been the particular mask they were using and/or the silicone frame wasn't fitting properly.  We are all different, I think I lucked out.  I haven't decided if I will use double sided tape or tack them into my masks for ""busy"" use - but when I am sitting here just testing them out with my various masks and now the double masking process - the frame sits solidly in my mask and while I am not talking, it seems to be staying in place without any tape or tacking.  It may be different if you're talking a lot or moving your head a lot.  I also read a review that said the frame was too heavy and they couldn't keep their mask on... that is an ear adjustment issue I think.  I have not had that issue.  I plan to wash them on the top rack of my dishwasher as others have noted they have done this without any problems.  Having said all of that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  All in all, these really help me to feel less claustrophobic in my mask by keep the mask away from my mouth while breathing.  Look, ultimately the whole reason to mask/double mask is to protect yourself and others from the virus. You gotta wear your masks properly.  If these don't fit your face, definitely don't use them. I personally think because they are reusable they are worth the expense and effort to see if they will work for you.  If you don't mind your mask touching your mouth, you probably don't need them.  We've got to wear them to reduce the variants and bring the pandemic to an end!

It is firm to press the broom handle into the ""hold"" position, but it is sturdy.  I have a key hook holder, but I put my car fob on it because it's so easy to find - separate from all the other piles of keys.  It has a shiny silver metal flat base.

They are pretty short.. around 6"".  But the light can be really bright... or... not.  There are 5 positions for brightness.  The less bright you go, the longer the battery will last.

4.0,under cabinet light strip,"I purchased a longer version of just this from a different seller... but sadly they sensor didn't work on either of two.  But I really loved the idea of these, so I rolled the dice on this version.  I purchased 2 sets as I had before.  I have to admit these are really too short (only about 1') BUT the sensors worked!  The timer is a bit off, but it's close enough and as I mentioned, the sensor works perfectly.  They are super easy to install - however, getting the non stick paper off to reveal the sticky part was a bit of a trick as the the non stick wanted to lift off with the sticky part - had to work a bit on that. Once I got the non- stick part of the tape off, stuck the light strip under my bathroom cabinet and set the sensor. There is a circular magnet piece to attach the sensor to. It's sort of a weaker magnet, but it works.  The sensor is the rechargeable piece.  So, once it needs to be charged, you just unplug the sensor, charge it and reinstall.<br />PROS.... really easy to install.  Sensors are effective.<br />CONS... sensor magnet could be a lot stronger.. the nonstick part of the sticky tape was too hard to peel apart without lifting the sticky section.<br />Can't really rate on this.. but I wish the light string was about 1' longer.<br />I've had the strip up and running for about a week -  so far, so good.

The sticky strip worked well and I feel it would have probably stayed up.  The problems lay with the sensor/battery unit.  They didn't work.  When I say ""they"" - I purchased 2.  So, I charged them fully.  Set one light strip up and plugged in. Note: the sensor/battery has a circular magnet to attach to wall or whatever you have to apply.  I liked that as you need to recharge.  But, the light came on and wouldn't turn off.  Even though I had set for 15 seconds and night only.  I charged up and tried again.  Now the light won't come on at all.  So because I had already stuck the strip up I thought I'd try the sensor/battery pack of the other set in case one was bad.  Nope.  Neither worked.  One of the sensors would work in pitch black - but only about 2 out of 10 tries.  All in all, the other reviews that stated the sensors were bad - were right.  Dang it.

3.0,waterfall faucet,"[[VIDEOID:a9acf5d63a0f761d3938fa7867aec297]] UPDATE BELOW<br />I just put in a vessel type sink in my bathroom and had chosen a more spout pour faucet.  The problem was the water would splash over the front edge of the sink.  When we tried to reduce the pressure of the water, it wasn't enough pressure to rinse.  So, I purchased this style.  The waterfall effect ""fans"" the water so there is less of a ""hose"" stream of water and while we did slightly lower the pressure, the water now stays in the sink.  In addition, the faucet is quite lovely.  I was worried it was a bit too modern, but it looks very nice with the brushed satin texture and the oval shape that matches my vessel sink and the beveled edge mirror above it.  It's actually quite a nice look.  Also the faucet itself is quite weighty - I hope this equates with quality.  The previous faucet was super loud too - like a jet plane taking off... this one is quite pleasant, sounds like water, not a jet plane. Those are all the pros... there were a couple of ""cons"" I've noticed so far... the water doesn't stop immediately... it's sort of slowly stops pouring.  I didn't see any where to adjust for this so I am hoping it won't end up a dripper or leaker. The other is that the hoses that were included with faucet were WAY too short.  Fortunately the hoses from the other faucet we were replacing fit.  Lucky shot.

It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI, so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint, I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.

They say they are stainless steel, it looks like they are. They stand up at least an 1"" so you will loose an inch of depth - but to me, it's worth it to be able to more easily clean the sink.  They also work with hot pans.  Probably could be put in the dishwasher, but you'd need to take the rubber pieces off I would think.  I plan to just hand wash mine.

1.0,set of 2 smaller flashlights,"UPDATE BELOW...Initially I was thinking these were pretty good... but as I use them I am finding some disappointing behavior.  Mostly that the on/off toggle at the base of the flashlight is wonky.  Sometimes it works... other times not.  I end up shaking it.  Then it comes on.  This has been the case on both flashlights.  Now, my original post was rejected because I mentioned some broken plastic tubing in the packaging... I wonder if that has anything to do with the glitchy issues I am having.  Cannot say, but it is suspect.  In my original review I included a pic of the broken pieces, but I will skip those this time.  They are black metal.  You pull the neck out to tighten or widen the beam.  I am a bit disappointed in the overall quality - ie: the toggle failure - shake to get to turn on.  I was purchasing these to replace old ones that did the same!  The batteries (NOT included) go in the bottom, twist tight to function.  The lens piece was very loose on both - it twists off - so I tightened those too.  There is a wrist band attached - I don't use those.  I have found that if you press and hold a second or two, it works more reliably.  If you're in a hurry and do a quick tap of the toggle - about 50/50.  So don't be in a hurry.  The toggle button is orange, but not neon.  With the batteries in, they are fairly weighty.  Fit in a pocket.  Not sure how much more ""focused"" on the product I can get and additionally honestly reveal my experience.

5.0,Elongated toilet seat with lid,"I ordered the gray and placed on a white throne - goes with new flooring I just installed.  Looks great in my opinion.  Was really easy to install as the seat I replaced had the same bolts - took about 2 minutes.  The surface of the old seat had failed - about 8 years old... they don't last forever.  As I mentioned the gray seat looks really good on the white base and is very light gray - you can see the difference, but it is subtle in color.  Time will tell how this seat will stand up.  It's fairly heavy - but not too heavy. I ordered the elongated shape.  Comes with the seat and lid.  The surfaces are very smooth.  Overall, for the price, I am very happy with the purchase.

5.0,tiki torch solar lights,These are large and look like REAL flames.  They are SO awesome.  I did have to put them in the backyard area because we have a street light that shines directly over our small front yard - which means it doesn't get dark enough to trigger the torches to come on... but turns out they are even more awesome in our bamboo inspired back yard.  The solar charge panel is directly on the top...  At our house (in Arizona) they last all night long... they turn off and charge in the daylight.  They come with adjustable height stakes (one or two sections - which are black plastic) - we added bamboo poles on ours with a little adjustment for multi lengths - a better look for our yard.

2.0,battery wall switch,"Meh.  So, they give you instructions about the battery... but there is a plate (the wall hanging plate- that the instruction do NOT show at all) that I actually had to snap off the back to get to the battery to remove the battery saving tab.  What a drag.  And now, even though the base is only about 5 ft away from the switch, it only works about 50% of the time.  I will probably just toss it when I get frustrated enough about it not working well.  I hate to write reviews that are less than 5 star - but occasionally this is going to happen.  :(<br />2/27/2019 - full disclosure - I have been asked to reconsider my original review and have been provided another switch by the seller.  Sadly, I have nothing more positive to say about the switch.  One of the most disappointing points of this switch is that in order to use the switch you must remove the back plate to access the battery box.  The problem I had with the first switch is the same with the second one provided.  It simply will not budge.  It doesn't slide... it doesn't pop off... it is solidly attached.  You must 'force' the plate off, which is plastic, and of course, breaks.  So you plan to use it as desk top or table top switch - you're good.  However, you won't be able to attach to a wall after breaking the back panel simply to access the battery box.  I had the same issues with the second one as with the first, it doesn't work more than it does as a switch.  It is a toggle - so you press it over and over again - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Note: the switch was about 2ft from the receiver - well within the distance specifications. Frustrating to say the least.  I really appreciate that the seller is trying to address their production issues.  They have been friendly and active.  I believe that they are genuinely trying to address all of these issues. I am an Amazon customer for over 25 years - carefully and honestly reviewing thousands of items.  It is rare to have a seller so seemingly committed and forthwith in their communication with me.  I do wish I had more positive things to say about this switch - but I think their issue is with the makers of these switches - not the seller.  I anticipate they will be able to make easy changes in the production - such as not attaching the wall plate before shipping.  As for the other issues - sometimes you have work out quality control as well. I thank the seller for contacting me and for seeking out my input as to what the issues are.  I just wish I could have changed my review to their benefit.",[],B07HRD1GXP,B07RGN9DY9,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,1546911923208,59,True
5.0,6ft cherry tree,"I ordered this for a plain corner in my semi tiny house and it is perfect... I have included some pics for you to see about the construction and materials.  Took about 5 minutes to set up.  The flowers are a silicone type material, soft and pliable.  The lights are LED and they have a soft white glow.  I purchased a switch to turn them on remotely - no on off switch, just a plug in.  The tree arrives bent at the top but is about 6 ft tall.  *NOTE: in the photo I actually have it standing on small table about 8"" tall behind the chair as I wanted the lower branches a bit taller.  I love the look of it and the soft glow it gives.  It came with spare parts (flowers, etc) which I taped the bag to the base as in my case, you are not going to be looking at the base.  The base is a plastic stand you put together, I used the heel of my hand to pound just a bit to get the base made.  The tree is wrapped with a dark brown tape that works well in my room with the dark brown leather furniture.  As long as it lasts a decent amount of time, I couldn't be happier.  A few other notes:<br /> There is a slight plastic smell... in case you're super sensitive.. it hasn't bothered me too much and I think it will dissipate over time... Also, the tree can sort of tip over if you don't the branches balanced out fairly well.. there are 2 pieces and the top portion, with all the branches has a bit of weight to it as you can imagine.

5.0,mason jar lights,"These are just the lids and lights... NO JARS.  I knew this going in, so I purchased my own jars and some polished rocks to use as weights - we have rambunctious ground squirrels.  I also purchased, separately, &#34;stainless steel&#34; handles as we live on the ocean front in Oregon.  The handles were a bit of trick to get on the jar - it works best if you &#34;screw&#34; them on, like a lid sort of.  I sort of twirled the lights so they hung down as a swirl down the center of the jar and then screwed the lids onto the jars.  They charge in the day, come on at dusk and mostly stay on all night long.  A couple I notice don't.. but I was only hoping for a few hours - so I'm good with this.  They are not really bright enough to use a path way light - but they are bright enough to be a very pretty decoration.  I ordered a dozen, but went back for a third set as my very determined squirrels did manage to shatter one by knocking it off even with rocks for weights!  My Mom loved them, so I let her take three of them.  She has them in her window sill, inside.  They work nicely there too.  As long as they get sun to charge, it's good.  Now, I will say, that the rings have become to rust.  I haven't tried to pop out the light portion and put a new ring on, but I may try this after the summer season is over.  All work.  I had NO failures.  Some don't last through the night, even though they have exactly the same sun exposure - but still, last for hours.  I do recommend putting something in the jars for weights even if you don't have sassy squirrels like we do as they will likely stay put better.  ..As I said I used polished rocks.. but you could use glass beads or marbles or shells that heavy or packaged sand (because its dry - don't get it off the beach) really anything that would provide weight and you can fit into the canning jar. All in all, I really like these lights... just wish the rings were more resistant to rust! They would make beautiful wedding decor, or other party decor  or individually as gifts with special inserts (weights).  My Mom adores hers.

I may not attempt to replace the rings until they are not functional anymore - a couple seasons?? I DO recommend the separate purchase of the handles.  They make the jars a lot easier to move around.

It was very easy to set.  The &#34;body&#34; (black  part) is about 3 or 4&#34; long... so it's larger- but the bail is pretty thin... around 1/4&#34; wide.. (of less - just eyeballing it)...It is kinda heavy in weight - but not overly. I wish it were a bit heavier duty... but this will work.  We are using on a indoor storage unit.

5.0,2 bike stand,"My husband and I each have a bike and this stand is sooo convenient to park them on.  I will say that my husband drilled and attached the stand to our cement patio.  So it is extra stable.  His bike is taller than mine so mine parks nicely next to his, just under his handle bars.  I think if you had 2 bikes of the same height, they are parked so closely together you MIGHT have handle bar conflicts.  Just FYI.  The stand itself is black and pretty lightweight aluminum - which is why is anchored ours.  The tips of the tubs have rubber or rubber-like &#34;stoppers&#34; but it doesn't really hold the stand in place when you are trying to park the bikes - if you are not anchoring you could &#34;lift&#34; the bikes in place and readjust the stand.  Anchoring ours means we do not have to use the kick stands - I am not sure if the stand would hold a bike without the kick stand otherwise.

I got the hose out... rinsed the rocks all off and allowed them to dry.  Used a blower to get rid of extra dust and pine needles (from neighbors pine tree) and sprayed evenly.

It toggles to the left and right for the 2 brightness options and the middle is &#34;off.&#34;  The base is &#34;weighted&#34; but not terribly heavy, which is good for me - but if you're expecting a super weight, it is not.

5.0,Salt lamp bowl,"I purchased two of these for my tiny AZ home... one for the master bedroom and one for the living/dining area.  I have never purchased a salt lamp before and I cannot speak to the list of possible benefits, but I am hopeful for positive results.  However, having said that, the lamp is lovely.  The dimmer switch is very nice.  You can control the brightest easily using the dimmer switch which clearly changes the mood.  The salt chunks are large and each chunk is unique in color and size and shape as you can imagine.  The bowl holder is a clear acrylic type material... about 8&#34; in diameter - just eye balling it... and about 6&#34; tall.  It came very carefully and beautifully packaged.  Once you put the salt in the bowl I can image that you don't want to move them around a lot as it could scratch the bowl.  I did carefully move a few pieces to places I felt were better.  I have had the lamps plugged in for about 8 hours... no odors.  Just a really beautiful glow.  The dimmer switch is hard.  You just tap it to turn it on or off and gently press to dim or brighten. There is a very nice booklet with instructions on how to change the bulb (a spare is provided) Cleaning instructions say: regularly dust salt crystals with a dry, clean cloth. Do not wash or clean with water or detergents, If not in use for a long period of time, store the lamp in a cool, dry environment, covering the crystals with a plastic bag.  The lamp may naturally moisten in humid environments - saying further that if you use in a humid environment leave the lamp on for several hours to naturally dry out (I'm thinking like in a bathroom?) They also note not to place to close to electronics as the salt may draw moisture.  It says if the salt crystals become moist - gently pat down with a clean dry cloth - also noting not to clean the bowl with any organic or other solvents or it may become damaged.<br />I would say if you're looking to purchase one of these as a gift, they are beautifully packaged and look very high end. The price is definitely higher than some of the options but not the highest. I personally chose the bowl style of salt crystal because salt may draw moisture and I wanted it contained instead of dripping off a free standing rock without containment.

Hope this helps you in your decision.<br />UPDATE:  2/10/2017.... I have been using both lamps 24/7 for some weeks now.  Both are still working perfectly.  I still believe these salt lamps are a really good buy. I've looked at so many in person that were so much more money and so much less lamp.  I think one of the best parts is the dimming light.  You can really adjust to comfort, for instance, in the bedroom.  Still feel these lamps are really 5 star items.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JbR8nrdaL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JbR8nrdaL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JbR8nrdaL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SI31IRykL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SI31IRykL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SI31IRykL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WztxROkkL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WztxROkkL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71WztxROkkL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j1kneO5yL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j1kneO5yL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71j1kneO5yL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lJfOL-8GL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lJfOL-8GL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lJfOL-8GL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oI9-HjtRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oI9-HjtRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oI9-HjtRL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKnUrwWtL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKnUrwWtL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZKnUrwWtL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iqnGqcdmL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iqnGqcdmL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81iqnGqcdmL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01M18TLZ5,B08Q9B7LTL,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,1483757313000,116,True

(Darn it) - cause me to drop the 5 star to a 4... Also, the lights are white... not warm and glowy at all. The measurements given appear to be accurate, eyeballing it.  If the &#34;flicker&#34; was more realistic I would probably buy 4 more to really fill my windows..<br />They are similar in weigh to the old ones.

I took pics to show what you get in the box. Mine is the white with blue button. I purchased the industrial velcro to attach because I wanted to be able to remove the transmitter when needed for battery or other... The front door transmitter is about 15 feet from the base and rings every time... the back door transmitter is about 20 feet from the base and rings every time. I chose 2 different rings so I could tell which was the back door and which was the front (one of the reasons I purchased 2 units). There is a volume button with 4 volume choices. You will need an outlet to plug in the receiver (the bell). As I just installed these I will be updating with any useful information. So far, they work perfectly. They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition with other items I purchased.  I do NOT receive compensation for my reviews of ANY kind.<br />UPDATE:  6/28/2016....  I have discovered that if the power flickers or goes out, you will need to reset your chime choice.  I wish there was switch that would just &#34;set&#34; your choice with a battery backup source (?)
