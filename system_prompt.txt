### Task: Generate Base Product Specifications

**Context:**
- Domain: {DOMAIN}
- Category: {CATEGORY}

**Instruction:**
Create a comprehensive specification sheet for a standard "{CATEGORY}" product.
Since this is the "Base" or "Entry" model, the specs should be balanced and representative of the market average for an entry-level product.
Focus on numerical values (e.g., weight, dimensions, performance scores) that affect user experience.
Ignore specific brand identity; assume a generic, standard brand.

**Required Keys in JSON:**
- "price": (in USD, integer)
- "release_year": (e.g., 2024)
- "main_features": (list of 3 key selling points)
- "technical_specs": (dictionary of 5~8 key-value pairs specific to {DOMAIN}. e.g., CPU, RAM for phones / Horsepower, MPG for cars)

**Output:**
Provide ONLY the JSON object.
